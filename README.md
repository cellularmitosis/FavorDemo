# Favor demo app

A set of demos for my job application with Favor Delivery:

- FavorSwiftUI (a.k.a. "MyFavor") is a fully-SwiftUI demo application
- FavorUIKit is a hybrid of UIKit and SwiftUI, representing a UIKit-to-SwiftUI migration
  - This is an AppDelegate + UITabController with hosted SwiftUI Views from MyFavor

Compare the "site maps" of the two demos:

## Screenshots (MyFavor)

Here are a few screenshots comparing the MyFavor app to the Favor website:

My demo adds a new feature: the ability to keep a list of "favorited" restaurants:

Additionally, a request log is useful for verifying the network request de-duplicating and for keeping an eye on endpoint latency:
