# Favor demo app

A simple SwiftUI demo for my Favor Delivery job application.


## Screenshots

Here are a few screenshots comparing my app to the Favor website:

<img width="1635" height="977" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2 38 45 AM" src="./.media/Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2.38.45 AM.png" />

<img width="1632" height="975" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2 39 10 AM" src="./.media/Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2.39.10 AM.png" />

<img width="1633" height="979" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2 39 55 AM" src="./.media/Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2.39.55 AM.png" />

My demo adds a new feature: the ability to keep a list of "favorited" restaurants:

<img width="454" height="984" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2 40 26 AM" src="./.media/Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2.40.26 AM.png" />

Additionally, a request log is useful for verifying the network request de-duplicating and for keeping an eye on endpoint latency:

<img width="456" height="981" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2 40 58 AM" src="./.media/Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 2.40.58 AM.png" />
