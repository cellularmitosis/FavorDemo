A simple SwiftUI demo for my Favor Delivery job application.


## Screenshots

Here are a few screenshots comparing my app to the Favor website:

My demo adds a new feature: the ability to keep a list of "favorited" restaurants:

Additionally, a request log is useful for verifying the network request de-duplicating and for keeping an eye on endpoint latency:
